        <h3 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Love you always!, I know we still have alot more pictures but there's to many to include it all so i just did get 3 of our memorable pictures and i chose these pictures because this made pictures made me feel you are so genuine to me and i felt very lucky to find someone like you.
            Even tho kani ra nga pics ang nakita, These still shows our memories and gives a reason to continue our relationship, first pic, shows how grateful we are, you were grateful for the flower i gave,
            and I was grateful to spend the day with you and felt nervous giving the flower.</h3>
            <br>
           
            <h3 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Second pic is also a very memorable picture because this was the day you introduced me to your parents, I was then very happy kay imo jd ko gipailaila sa ilaha even tho we barely knew each other
                this bacame a reason for me not to give up on you kay it would dissapoint your parents.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3 style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"> Third pic was memorable kay this was our first laag together and we never expected unsay mahitabo that day, and this was the day i kept saying nga love na tka just because you were literally the ony girl nga akong gi unhan ug ing ato nga move.
